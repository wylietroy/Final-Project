Game Description

This game is  called Frogger, the goal of the game is to reach the other side as many times as possible before failing to cross. The catch is that there is no reset if you get hit instead you will be notified you got hit and continue going on. There is no timer and no limit, the goal is to challenge yourself. How many can you score without being hit? How many times can you get hit before scoring? It all up to you to see how far you can go with what you want to achieve.
